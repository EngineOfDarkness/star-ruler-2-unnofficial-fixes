	Description: <<
		Bugfixes and other Enhancements

		[b]Entries prefixed with an exclamation mark ! WILL BREAK OLD saves (won't load correctly) - you need to start a new game, period.
		The same applies when the first version number changes if you update. See README for details.[/b]
		
		[b]Please note that using this with other big mods MIGHT create horrible crashes and weird game behaviour due to conflicts.[/b]
		
		[b]In such case I would advise informing the author of the mod you are using, so he can merge things he wants or needs from this mod.[/b]
